##Project Overview

This project analyzes user behavior in an e-commerce platform specializing in wine sales. Using event-level data (session_id, event_name, title, country, traffic_source, device, etc.), the analysis focuses on conversion metrics, CTR, product performance, and behavioral insights by country, traffic source, and device type.
The results help to understand user interactions, identify top-performing wines, and reveal conversion dynamics across different user segments.
